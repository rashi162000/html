	<h3><p> Bhopal (/boʊˈpɑːl/; Hindustani pronunciation: [bʱoːpaːl] (About this soundlisten)) is the capital city of the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh and the administrative headquarters of both Bhopal district and Bhopal division.[3] It is known as the City of Lakes[4] for its various natural and artificial lakes and for being one of the greenest cities in India.[5] It is the 16th largest city in India and 131st[6] in the world. After formation of Madhya Pradesh, the state capital Bhopal was a part of the Sehore district. It was bifurcated in 1972 and a new district Bhopal was formed.

Founded in 1707, the city was the capital of the former Bhopal State, a princely state of the British ruled by the Nawabs of Bhopal. Numerous heritage structures from this period include the Taj-ul-Masajid and Taj Mahal palace. In 1984, the city was struck by the Bhopal disaster, one of the worst industrial disasters in history.

A Y-class city,[7] Bhopal houses various educational and research institutions and installations of national importance, including ISRO's Master Control Facility,[8] BHEL, and AMPRI. Bhopal is home to the largest number of institutes of National Importance in India, namely IISER, MANIT, SPA, AIIMS, NLIU, IIFM and IIIT (currently functioning from a temporary campus inside MANIT).</p></h3>
